# Project FCF (Flush Conceivable Fakers)

## Introduction
This is a shit-like simple project for blocking twitter bots (presumably from Chinese powers) that follows you, to improve the use experience.

Update 10/2023: As shitty Elon Musk disabled Twitter API for free users, I can't use this personally now, but I strongly suggest against donating money to the shitty X platform (debris of former Twitter).

## Usage
5 modes are available.

### Mode A
Block all non-friend followers.

Used when you feel anxiety about your social media privacy issue

### Mode A2
Block all non-friend followers without enough common friends, except locked (protected) ones.

Used when you want to clear weirdoes following you, but not want to hurt normal followers with common friends.

### Mode B
Block all locked accounts in non-friend followers.

Be cautious to use since this would hurt friendly normal protected followers.

### Mode C
Block all followers with a particular follower/following ratio.

Sorta practical in judging conceivable fakers, huh.

### Mode D
Block all followers with a particular follower number.

Kinda practical but not really.
