# Project FCF (Flush Conceivable Fakers)

## Introduction
This is a shit-like simple project for blocking twitter bots (presumably from Chinese powers) that follows you, to improve the use experience.

Update 10/2023: As shitty Elon Musk disabled Twitter API for free users, I can't use this personally now, but I strongly suggest against donating money to the shitty X platform (debris of former Twitter).

## Usage
5 modes are available.

### Mode A
Block all non-friend followers.

Used when you feel anxiety about your social media privacy issue

### Mode A2
Block all non-friend followers without enough common friends, except locked (protected) ones.

Used when you want to clear weirdoes following you, but not want to hurt normal followers with common friends.

### Mode B
Block all locked accounts in non-friend followers.

Be cautious to use since this would hurt friendly normal protected followers.

### Mode C
Block all followers with a particular follower/following ratio.

Sorta practical in judging conceivable fakers, huh.

### Mode D
Block all followers with a particular follower number.

Kinda practical but not really.

## Trivia
"FCF" initially means something far more aggro and derogatory, but was reported by Chinese users as "racial" and "hateful" and thus was forced to censored to the currenty meaning by Github.

One can easily figure out or speculate what it was meant to be initially, given that they personally knows the author, Lena Shizuki, and her relentless agony & ressentment (<- a French word borrowed by F. Nietzsche).
